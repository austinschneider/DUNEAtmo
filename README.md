# DUNEAtmo
## cross_sections
Contains the neutrino interaction cross sections for injection

## injection
Contains the code for injecting the primary neutrinos
Uses the C++ interface of a modified LeptonInjector

## likelihood
Contains the likelihood code for performing the analysis

## propagation
Contains code for propagating muons

## proposal_config
Contains the configuration files used by PROPOSAL (the muon propagator)

## weighting
Contains code for computing the generation probability and saving the information to a file.
Uses the LWpy weighting software and relies on some geometry functions in LeptonInjectorDUNE

## fluxes
[Legacy] Contains some neutrino fluxes

## lv_ratio_implementation
[Legacy] Contains an implementation of the LV flux hypothesis that is based on ratios of survival probabilities

## plotting
[Legacy] Contains plotting code for the data sample
